# semanticdatabase - classes generation

This work is heavily inspired by the work of Thomas Beale, but has its own purposes, meanings and naming

Thomas Beale's work can somewhere be found here:

The HTML-files come from the original openehr-website, but because of strange constructs, 
I did restructure them with help of Libre Office and Visual Studio in a way that they
only contain tables and class-information.

This should be done to process new versions of these files when taken from the Openehr-website
