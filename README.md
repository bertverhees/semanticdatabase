# A new way of modeling

# The vocabulaire

First you agree on the vocabulaire in which to model, for that purpose is the module Vocabulaire in this project.
It allows to define words (in classes) and define the meanings in properties and relations.

The target is to have a fail-safe vocabulaire class-system, a way to store and open a vocabulaire, and a primitive gui to define a new  or to open/change an existing vocabulaire

# The model which uses the vocabulaire

I come back to this when my code arrives this point

# OpenEhr

This work is heavily inspired by the work of Thomas Beale, but has its own purposes, meanings and naming

Thomas Beale's work can somewhere be found here:

This readme will be expanded later.
